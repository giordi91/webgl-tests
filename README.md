# webgl-tests
This repositry is a scratchpad for my tests in webgl. The core classes for handling opengl stuff are evolving with each project,
they will be merged eventaully on master at one point and leave me with a library like set of utility for future tests.
For now there is a branch for each test.
The main tests are:
3D viewport:
http://www.marcogiordanotd.com/webgl/viewport/viewport.html

A 3d viewport with support for color and normal map textures.

2D drawing:
http://www.marcogiordanotd.com/webgl/drawing/drawing.html

A simple 2D drawing test.

There is still crap around of simpler tests like triangles helloworld etc that will be cleaned up at one point.
